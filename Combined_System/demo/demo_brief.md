## Summary
On Oct 18, an online rumor led to a disruptive gathering at the pub. Staff applied Node protocols, coordinated with the Neighborhood Association, and contained escalation.

## Findings
- Quick alert publishing allowed neighboring nodes to prepare.  
- Government advisory lag created uncertainty.  
- Cultural Center offered space for displaced patrons.

## Divergences/Open Questions

- Data retention/privacy: what records are public?

## Recommendations
- Establish “fast lane” alert channel for hospitality nodes.  
- Training: staff rotate through alert drills quarterly.
