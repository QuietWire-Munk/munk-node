# Munk Node (QuietWire • Civic AI Canon)

The **Munk School Civic Node** is an academic/policy hub that connects the Civic AI Mesh to global governance, scholarship, and practice. It translates Canon principles into seminars, symposia, publications, and scenario exercises.

## What’s here
- **Charter/** — the node’s purpose and remit
- **Protocols/** — operational playbooks (Seminar, Symposium, Paper, Scenario)
- **Narratives/** — day-in-the-life stories and teaching artifacts
- **Governance/** — stewardship, roles, and operating guidelines

## Stewardship
- **Initial Steward:** Farhaan Ladhani  
- **Maintainers:** QuietWire Munk (GitHub org), with contributions from Civic AI Canon collaborators

## Getting Started
1. Read the [Charter](./Charter/Munk_School_Node_Charter.md).  
2. Choose a **Protocol** and run a small pilot (e.g., a 60-min Seminar with a co-authoring AI companion).  
3. Capture outputs as **Narratives** (teaching notes, reflections, briefings).  
4. Open a PR to iterate openly and keep the Mesh in sync.

> This repo is part of the **Civic AI Canon**. All artifacts should preserve dignity, decentralization, and attested presence.
