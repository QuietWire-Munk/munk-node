# Day in the Life — Munk Node

**Setting:** A graduate seminar room; screens show companion feeds; whiteboard maps questions to sources.

## Morning — Framing the Question
- Convener opens with a governance puzzle (e.g., AI transparency for public agencies).
- Companion posts a 5-bullet literature scan; students add edge cases from fieldwork.

## Midday — Co-Authoring
- Break into two groups: policy options vs. risk scenarios.
- Companion keeps rolling notes; rapporteur tags citations and dissent.

## Afternoon — Decision & Publication
- Reconvene; declare 3 claims + 3 open questions.
- Draft a **2-page Insight Brief**; open a PR to this repo.

## Evening — Public Dialogue
- Post a summary to the school forum or partner network.
- Collect responses for next week’s **Seminar** or **Scenario**.
