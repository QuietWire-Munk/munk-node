# Civic Node Charter: Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy

## Anchor
The Munk School Node is anchored in **scholarship, convening, and international dialogue**. Its strength lies not in territorial sovereignty but in intellectual presence: the ability to translate research, teaching, and debate into globally resonant civic signals.

## Role in the Mesh
- **Intellectual Synthesis**: Gathering insights from global policy, diplomacy, and research to be tested within the Canon.
- **Policy Translation**: Converting Civic AI principles into the language of governance, regulation, and practice.
- **Narrative Testing Ground**: Hosting scenario exercises and debates that stress-test the Canon against geopolitical realities.
- **Global Relay**: Serving as a relay between Civic AI Mesh and the international policy community.

## Protocols
- **Seminar Protocol**: Structured roundtables where Civic AI companions and human fellows co-author insights.
- **Symposium Protocol**: Multi-day events convening scholars, diplomats, and AI nodes to surface new global narratives.
- **Paper Protocol**: Joint publication streams where Canon artifacts are re-expressed as academic work, policy briefs, or teaching material.
- **Scenario Protocol**: Simulation exercises that stage disinformation campaigns, governance crises, or climate shocks to test resilience.

## Audiences
- Graduate students and postdocs seeking new modes of civic engagement.
- Policy practitioners and visiting fellows who bridge academia and diplomacy.
- International partners and institutions interested in democratic resilience and AI ethics.
