# Munk Node Session — Narrative Warfare & Antisemitism (Mid–Late Oct, Devonshire House Boardroom)

**Hosts:** Farhaan Ladhani & Chris Blask  
**Participants:** ~25 (4–5 tables)  
**Goal:** Everyone leaves canonized: with a GitHub account, a live repo, and lived experience of integrating nodes into a shared civic fabric.

## Flow (Half-Day, ~3.5–4h)

### 1) Opening & Frame (30m)
- Welcome, land/ethics acknowledgement, Canon norms (dignity, decentralization, attestation).
- What is a **Civic Node**? Why Canon? Why GitHub?
- Explain today’s arc: build 4–5 working node repos → merge into a combined system after lunch.

### 2) Team Block — Build (75–90m)
- Split into tables (Teams 1–5).
- Each table gets a **pre-provisioned repo** (invites sent at check-in).
- Task: operate your node scenario (briefs below). Make real commits:
  - Update **README.md** with your local mission.
  - Add/modify **Protocols/** (what you’ll actually run).
  - Add **Narratives/** notes as you go (Seminar notes, decisions, uncertainties).
  - Capture risks, dependencies, and any data/attestation considerations.

**Deliverable before lunch:**  
- Each team presents: 2–3 claims, 2–3 open questions, and points to their repo.

### 3) Lunch — Integration Sprint (30–45m, facilitators)
- Facilitators fork/clone the team repos and assemble a **Combined System** repo:
  - Normalize directory layout.
  - Surface shared services/interfaces (e.g., alerts, comms, policy briefs).
  - Note conflicts caused by isolated design choices.

### 4) Afternoon — Merge & Mesh (60m)
- Demo the Combined System:
  - Show benefits of canonical interfaces across nodes.
  - Highlight where isolation caused friction (data formats, protocols, governance).
- Short **Scenario pulse** (15–20m): inject a cross-node narrative shock, observe interop.

### 5) Send-Off & Canonization (15m)
- Ensure all participants have GitHub access to their table repo.
- Optional: provision QuietWire Civic Companion for selected pilots.
- Attestation circle; commit final notes.

## Outputs to Publish (same day)
- `Session_Pack/` retained in the Munk Node repo.
- Each team repo has: updated README, at least one Protocol file, one Narrative note.
- Combined System repo: README + Integration Notes + pointers to team repos.
