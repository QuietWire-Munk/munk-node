# Team 3 — Pub Node

**Context:** Neighborhood pub with nightly events; wants safety, compliance, and good relations.

## Tasks (commit artifacts)
1. **Protocols/:**
   - `Incident_Log_Protocol.md` (fights, harassment, doxxing → who records, where)
   - `Vendor_Comms_Protocol.md` (how you signal to suppliers after disruptions)
2. **Narratives/:** Note on a heated night tied to an online rumor—what you did.
3. **Governance/:** Staff training cadence; escalation contacts.

## Questions to answer
- What alert channels should you subscribe to from **Neighborhood** and **Cultural Center**?
- What data do you share back (without violating privacy)?
