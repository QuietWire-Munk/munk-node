# Team 1 — Small Manufacturer Node

**Context:** Regional parts maker (20 staff). Needs supply resilience, safety, and community trust.

## Tasks (commit artifacts)
1. **README.md:** State mission, stakeholders, operating constraints.
2. **Protocols/:**
   - `Quality_Incident_Protocol.md` (who does what in first 60 minutes)
   - `Supplier_Onboarding_Protocol.md` (attestations, data you require)
3. **Narratives/:** A Seminar note capturing risks (availability, misinformation, recalls).
4. **Governance/:** Minimal maintenance schedule + roles.

## Questions to answer
- What data needs to be shared with neighbors/gov? What stays private?
- What alert you’d want from the **Government** node? What can you give the **Neighborhood** node?
