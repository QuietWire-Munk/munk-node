# Team 4 — Government Department Node

**Context:** Municipal/public safety + comms. Needs inbound signals from community; must publish advisories.

## Tasks (commit artifacts)
1. **Protocols/:**
   - `Advisory_Issue_Protocol.md` (criteria, approval, multilingual release)
   - `Social_Signal_Intake.md` (how you triage tips/OSINT from nodes)
2. **Narratives/:** Note on a weekend surge—what you published, what you withheld, why.
3. **Governance/:** Transparency, records retention, privacy boundaries.

## Questions to answer
- What minimal interface you require from **all nodes** (fields, frequency)?
- What you’ll publish back (feeds, SLA) to help nodes self-govern?
