# Team 2 — Cultural Center Node

**Context:** Urban cultural hub running exhibits and community events; targeted by online harassment waves.

## Tasks (commit artifacts)
1. **Protocols/:**
   - `Event_Safety_Protocol.md` (online harassment → physical safety workflow)
   - `Narrative_Response_Protocol.md` (how you respond publicly with dignity)
2. **Narratives/:** Note on an antisemitic narrative spike and your response.
3. **Governance/:** Volunteer onboarding & code of conduct.

## Questions to answer
- What support from **Government** and **Neighborhood** nodes would help most?
- What’s your threshold for pausing an event? Who attests decisions?
