# Facilitator Script — Munk Session (Devonshire Boardroom)

## Opening (Farhaan, 10m)
- Welcome to the Munk Node. We convene scholarship and practice.
- Today you’ll *become part of* the Canon: hands-on repos, real decisions.

## Canon Primer (Chris, 10–15m)
- Canon = shared language + minimal protocols + public artifacts.
- Civic Node = a place/organization operating with those protocols.
- We default to **transparency with dignity**; we preserve dissent.

**House Norms**
- Attribute human + AI contributions.
- Preserve minority views in notes.
- No sensitive personal data in repos.

## Team Setup (5m)
- 4–5 tables: Manufacturer, Cultural Center, Pub, Government Dept, Neighborhood Association.
- Check invites; confirm you can push to your team repo.
- Appoint roles: Convener, Rapporteur, Ops, Comms, Risk.

## During Team Work (coach)
- Nudge toward *small commits*: README update, one protocol file, one narrative note.
- Ask: “What breaks if you scale this? What do you need from other nodes?”

## Pre-Lunch Readouts (timebox: 3m/team)
- Each team: 2–3 claims; 2–3 open questions; show repo path.

## Lunch Integration (facilitators, backstage)
- Clone/fork teams; build Combined System repo; note conflicts and bridges.

## Afternoon Demo
- Show how canonical interfaces let nodes cooperate.
- Inject short shock scenario: observe interfaces under stress.

## Closing
- Canonization checklist (accounts, repo access, next steps).
- Thank you; next seminar dates and how to stay in the Mesh.
